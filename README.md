# EmoChat: Emotional Helper

## Project Description
EmoChat is an innovative Emotional Helper designed to provide support and companionship by leveraging advanced technologies. Using a powerful convolutional network, EmoChat can recognize and respond to users' emotions, fostering meaningful conversations. Additionally, the project integrates real-time information from a heart rate sensor, connected to a NodeMCU device, to enhance the emotional intelligence of the system.

### Key Features and Benefits
- **Emotion Recognition:** Through the convolutional network, EmoChat accurately identifies users' emotions, allowing for empathetic responses and tailored interactions.
  
- **Heart Rate Integration:** By collecting data from a heart rate sensor via a NodeMCU device, EmoChat gains insights into users' physiological states, enabling a more personalized and adaptive user experience.

- **Conversational Support:** EmoChat serves as a friendly companion, offering support and engagement through natural language conversations. It can be a source of comfort, encouragement, or simply someone to talk to.
